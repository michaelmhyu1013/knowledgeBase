Social Platform

Message count is increased for each MESSAGE that is sent by the user. It does not count the number of conversations a user has. This was unclear in our requirements and we designed it to only increment on messages.

Post count is increased for each DISCUSSION that is created by the user. It does not count the number of 'REPLIES' that a user has made.

These are the intended behaviour or application given the requirements that were told.
